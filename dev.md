### Principle for hardcode
- Dont try to hardcode anything unless you have a very good reason to do so.
- Dont hardcode the module import over this library, as I plan to change it in the future.
- Every time you changed the code, please check there are build error or not. if there is, fix it immediately.

### Code style

- https://github.com/samber/mo
- Be sure to remember the functions these two library provide already
