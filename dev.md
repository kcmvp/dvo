### Principle for hardcode
- Dont try to hardcode anything unless you have a very good reason to do so.
- Dont hardcode the module import over this library, as I plan to change it in the future.
- Every time you changed the code, please check there are build error or not. if there is, fix it immediately.

### Code style 
- https://github.com/samber/lo
- https://github.com/samber/mo
- Be sure to remember the functions these two library provide already
- simpler is better


### workflow
- I noticed that you sometimes introduce build error, so everytime you change the code, please make sure there is no build error.
- list out the files you changed at the end of the task, and tell me why did you do those changes
